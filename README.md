# PyBer_Challenge
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib the results of the newly formed DataFrame will be compiled into a multple-line graph that will depict the total weekly fares from 01-01-2019 to 04-29-2019 for each city type.
### Results

 ![summary]https://github.com/ducluu27/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/Resources/Summary.png
 
When comparing the total rides between the different city types, urban cities had most number of rides and the rural cities had the least. The total ride count for urban cities is 2,405, while the rural ride count is 78. The driver count was the highest in urban cities at 2,405, while the rural cities had the lowest with 78. The city type with the highest total fares is urban at $39,854.38, while the city with the lowest total fares iis rural at $4,327.93. Rural had the highest average fare and fare per driver, while urban had the lowest average fare per ride and driver.

When comparing the total fare by city type in a 4 month period from January to April, urban cities on a weekly basis have hgiher fares of the three city types. Rural cities have the lowest total fares. 
 
 
 ### Summary
Overall based on the results of the different city types, urban cities have more ride counts out of the three therefore have the highest total fares.Bt the avearge fare per ride and driver is the lowest since there more drivers than rides. The rural cities had the lowest total fare but the average fare per ride and driver are the highest. One explanation for this that there are less drivers to rides.
